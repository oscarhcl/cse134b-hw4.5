# Weekly Response #8: The Colonial Gaze

Based on Stam and Spence's annotations, this quote captured my attention:

> "It produces us as subjects, transforming us into armchair conquistadores, affirming our sense of power while making the inhabitants of the Third World objects of spectacle for the First World's voyeuristic gaze"

This suggests that media doesn't just reflect reality but shapes how we see ourselves and others.

## The Exotic Spectacle in *Broken Blossoms*

This idea is clearly shown in *Broken Blossoms*, where the character Cheung Huan, a Chinese man, is presented as an object of spectacle for Western viewers. The film portrays him as mysterious and exotic, using dim lighting and traditional Chinese clothing to emphasize his foreignness and make him seem intriguing.

By focusing on his difference, the film frames Cheung Huan as someone to be observed rather than understood, reinforcing Western superiority. While the film tries to make viewers feel sorry for Cheung Huan's tragic story, it still highlights the power imbalance between the Western audience and the Third World character.

## Media as a Tool of Power

Mainstream media makes its audience feel powerful, putting them in a position of dominance. At the same time, it reduces people from colonized countries to objects for entertainment and observation, reinforcing the voyeuristic gaze described by Stam and Spence.

This aligns with the Stam and Spence quote, which also shows non-Western people as objects to be watched. I chose this quote because it shows how the media can subtly reinforce colonial power, not just through the story but through the underlying ideas about control, as seen in *Broken Blossoms*' portrayal of Cheung Huan.

## The Lasting Impact

By turning Cheung Huan into an exotic spectacle, the film strengthens the cultural dominance of the First World over the Global South. This demonstrates how cinema can perpetuate power structures even when attempting to generate sympathy for marginalized characters.
