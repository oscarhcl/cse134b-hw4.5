# Personal Discussion: Translation Preface Role

In our group project translating *The Ballad of Mulan* (木兰辞), my job is to write the preface. This means I introduce the poem and help readers understand its background, meaning, and importance before they read our translation.

## My Approach

I don't just want to summarize the story, I want to show why Mulan's story still matters today, especially when we think about family, bravery, and standing up against traditional gender roles. To make the preface fit well with the translation, I plan to work closely with Qihao, who is doing the translation from Chinese to English. We'll make sure my introduction matches the tone and message of the final translated poem.

## Influenced by Venuti

I'm especially influenced by Lawrence Venuti's article, *How to Read a Translation*. Venuti says people often forget that translations are not just copies of the original, they are new versions shaped by the translator's ideas and the new language and culture. He says we should read translations as translations, and notice the choices translators make.

This really shaped how I see my role. I want to help readers understand that a translation isn't just about switching words from one language to another, it's about making hard decisions, interpreting meaning, and finding the right balance between staying true to the original and making the text understandable to a new audience.

## Our Group Structure

Our group has divided roles to reflect how complex this process is:
- **Qihao** is doing the translation from Chinese to English, which takes a lot of careful thought and language skill
- **Weston** is gathering sources and background information
- **Christian** is improving the final English version to make sure it's clear and readable
- **My role** is to write the preface and explain the context behind both the poem and our choices as a group

## Challenges We Face

One challenge we already see is finding the right words. Since only one person, Qihao, is doing the translating, we might miss other possible meanings in the original text. It's hard for one person to fully capture everything.

To help with that, I plan to talk often with Qihao and ask questions about his choices. That way, I can make the preface stronger by explaining the decisions we made and why they matter.

## My Vision for the Preface

In the end, I don't just want the preface to be an introduction. I want it to show how much thought and effort goes into translating a work like Mulan. I want readers to see that every line in our version comes from deep thinking, not only about language, but about culture, history, and how we understand stories.

Venuti reminds us that we shouldn't expect a translation to feel exactly like the original. Instead, we should appreciate it as a new piece of writing, one that opens the door to another culture, even if it can't fully recreate it.

By thinking this way, I hope readers will see Mulan not just as a famous hero, but as a story reshaped by our team's collaboration. Every choice, from translation to tone, reflects careful interpretation. Our version doesn't try to replace the original, but instead brings it into a new cultural context with respect, clarity, and thoughtful engagement.
