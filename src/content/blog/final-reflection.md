## Part 1: My Writing Journey

Throughout this quarter, my writing strategies have evolved in ways that have helped me become a clearer and more focused writer. At the beginning of the term, I struggled with writing paragraphs that contained multiple ideas, which often made my writing feel disorganized. However, over time, I learned to focus on discussing one main idea per paragraph. This shift allowed me to present my thoughts more clearly and made my writing much more cohesive.

One of the biggest challenges I faced at the start was worrying about whether I would be able to complete all the reading on time without sacrificing quality. I was anxious about falling behind and not fully understanding the material. However, as I began to practice better annotating techniques, I noticed a significant improvement in my comprehension. Annotating helped me interact with the material more actively, which made it easier to remember and recall the ideas later.

With this improvement in my reading skills, I found it easier to engage with the material and process it at a deeper level. I also realized that I needed to remind myself to take my time while reading, rather than rushing through the material. By slowing down, I was able to understand the content better, which ultimately improved my writing.

From this experience, I learned an important lesson: **to be a good writer, you must first be a good reader**. Understanding the material thoroughly gives you the foundation to express more complex ideas in a clear and organized manner.

Moving forward in CAT 2, my goal is to continue building on the skills I developed in CAT 1. I want to expand my ability to think critically and express sophisticated ideas while still maintaining a coherent structure that makes my writing easy to follow.

## Part 2: Understanding Film as a Cultural Artifact

This quarter, I learned that film serves as a snapshot of society, capturing various aspects of culture, politics, and history during a particular time period. This understanding has completely changed the way I view films. I used to focus solely on the plot and dialogue, but now I pay attention to elements like camera angles, lighting, and costumes.

For instance, in *Flying Down to Rio*, the lively musical and flashy costumes show how people wanted fun and excitement during the tough times of the Great Depression. These visual choices tell a story beyond the plot, providing insight into the social and economic context of the time.

### The Auteur Theory

What stood out to me the most was the idea that directors were not always seen as the authors of their films. Andrew Sarris's "A word" introduced me to the concept of auteur theory, which reframed my understanding of a director's role in shaping a movie. It was fascinating to learn how this perspective evolved and to see examples of directors whose distinct styles have become synonymous with their work.

This shift in perspective helped me see *Modern Times* differently, as I began to appreciate Charlie Chaplin not just as a performer but as an auteur who used humor and satire to critique industrialization and the struggles of the working class.

### Film and Collective Memory

Films matter to me because they tell stories that are larger than themselves. As Viet Thanh Nguyen discusses in "Just Memory" and "Just Forgetting," the media plays a crucial role in shaping narratives and preserving collective memory. Movies not only reflect the director's vision but are also influenced by external forces, such as societal expectations and historical events.

Understanding these layers has deepened my appreciation for film as an art form and as a medium to understand the world and its history better.
