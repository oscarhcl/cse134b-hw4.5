# Translator's Introduction: The Ballad of Mulan

This introduction argues that my group's translation of *The Ballad of Mulan* (木兰辞) focuses on preserving Mulan as a powerful and relatable figure to convey the core message, that women can fight fiercely and overcome gender expectations, in order to resonate with contemporary American readers who are challenging the patriarchal structure of society.

By focusing on portraying Mulan's bravery and tenacity, combined with an emphasis on cultural readability, our approach demonstrates that it is possible for a translation to be faithful to the original story and still be able to deliver an interpreted message despite being adapted across languages and eras.

## The Story of Mulan

The song of Mulan, an early poetic work that dates to the Northern Wei dynasty (around 500 CE), tells the story of a well-known heroine named Hua Mulan, who is thought to have lived in the Northern and Southern dynasties (4th-6th century).

With no other men in the family, Mulan's elderly father received a call to join the army. She knew he was too old to survive the battlefield, and decided to take his place. At the time, women were not allowed to be in the army so she dressed as a man to deceive authorities in order to enroll in the military. She bought a horse and equipment from the local market and travelled far across the country to join the battle.

Decades Mulan spent on the battlefield, but her bravery and tenacity earned her the grave respect of generals and peers. When the war was over, her emperor offered her a respectable government position as a reward for her contributions, but she turned it down and asked for a horse to ride home. When Mulan finally reunited with her family, she surprised the fellow soldiers she had served with by telling them, for the first time, that she was a woman in the army.

## Why We Chose This Poem

The decision to translate *The Ballad of Mulan* comes from several suitability and practical factors. First and foremost, the poem has an important cultural significance both in China and globally. It has been adapted in musicals, operas and a well known Disney animated film. Mulan's story serves as an inspiration for people around the world from different eras, especially with the notion of defying the expectations of gender roles.

The second reason is that our group chose to translate a Chinese poem simply because three out of the four of us are fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese. Then, we agreed on finding a piece that is classical and well-known, so that there would be more reputable sources to support our interpretation of the original message.

Unlike most Chinese poems, which are often brief and compact, *The Ballad of Mulan* has a decent length which gives us more material to translate without losing much literal context from the original poem.

## The Freedom of No Known Author

Another reason that we chose to translate this poem is that there isn't a trace to who the actual author is to the poem. Unlike most classics by named authors, such as Wang Wei's *The Deer Park*, translating *The Ballad of Mulan* really gives us flexibility and ambiguity to the personal interpretation of the poem. We didn't need to consider an author's biography or personal philosophy, which makes it easier for us to focus directly on the cultural context and readability of the translation.

## Our Translation Process

Our approach involves dividing the task of literal translation to Qihao, Weston and myself. Each of us interpreted the basic meaning of different sentences, and aimed to preserve the word-for-word meaning.

Taking this excerpt as an example, "东市买骏马" literally translated as "In the east market, I buy a horse" (Weston's contribution), reflects the exact literal translation without added emotional inflection.

The second step was to iterate on these linear transliterations with further readability and tone improvements, which helps bring the core feminism message, that women can fight fiercely and overcome gender expectations, closer to the audience for better resonance. Our two-step method reflects a strategy which was inspired by multiple theorists and external sources.

## Influenced by Venuti

In *How to Read a Translation*, Lawrence Venuti emphasizes that translations are not literal copies of the original text but an interpreted rewriting shaped by cultural context with readers and writer's expectations. He argues that "the translator's language can also send down deep roots into the receiving culture" (Venuti).

In our case, the "receiving culture" is modern Americans. His argument supports our iterations of adding emotional tone to portray Mulan's strength, which formed new meanings for American readers that the original could not contain.

Most importantly, I chose to use verbs like "wrestle", which was not part of the original poem. The original text only portrayed a windy scenario. By incorporating a more proactive verb, it added more emotional force and depicted Mulan's strength more vividly. These choices align with our goal of presenting Mulan as a powerful and relatable figure, which helped the poem's core feminist message to transcend from ancient China to reach English-speaking audiences.

## Language Shapes Reality

In *Lost in Translation*, Lera Boroditsky says that "The structures that exist in our languages profoundly shape how we construct reality." This suggests a slight change in word choice can easily affect a reader's visualization of a character's motion.

After understanding this concept, it influenced my word choices and sentence construction when translating about the character of Mulan. Consider this except I worked on:

> "万里赴戎机，关山度若飞。朔气传金柝，寒光照铁衣。"

Which translates to:

> "I travelled tens of thousands of miles to join the battle, traversed through mountains with the speed of a rattle. I wrestle the ferocious Northern wind, and hear the war's sirens screams within."

While preserving the core actions of Mulan from the original poem, I revised the tone by adding adjectives like "ferocious" and used rhymes such as "battle" and "rattle" to enhance the imagery of her struggle in familiar English phrases which drove engagement with American readers.

## The Message Behind Our Translation

Our approach to translating the poem not only involves techniques that were inspired by theorists but we also gave thought to the message we want to convey behind our translation.

In *Mulan's Legend and Legacy in China and the United States*, Lan Dong argues that the poem "was a space for women to negotiate and maneuver toward their perceived interests" (Dong 76). Her perspective inspired me to interpret the poem in an angle that admires Mulan's tenacity, bravery and resilience.

Her argument supports our strategy of portraying Mulan as not just a loyal daughter, but more importantly, a timeless feminist figure who continues to challenge gender expectations which not only bridges the cultural barrier of China and the West but also a time frame of human development.

In the last line of the translation, "Who can tell which one is the female, which one is the male?" (Qihao's contribution), we directed western readers to reflect on the irrelevance of gender role confinement, which encourages them to think more critically on today's societal norms that still exist.

## Mulan as Cultural Text

Another writer we took inspiration from, is Sanping Chen who wrote *From Mulan To Unicorn* notes that the poem "reflects women's traditionally strong social role, something not unnoticed in Chinese historiography" (Chen 23). This positions the poem not just as folklore but a cultural text that could have layered interpretation.

This perspective influenced our translation choice of focusing on Mulan's character as a way to inspire younger Americans instead of translating the poem word-to-word. For example:

> "Walking out the door to see my battle buddies, They were all stunned: Fighting together for twelve years, Didn't know Mulan was a female."

This demonstrates Mulan's ability to take risks and achieve military accolades that were only thought to be a man's field. With the original transliteration, there wouldn't be an element of "stunned", which deviates from a higher level interpretation.

## Conclusion

To conclude, our translation fulfills its objective: portraying Mulan as a powerful figure to resonate with contemporary American readers who are challenging the status quo of gender roles in society. We did this by implementing a two-step approach. First: transliterate the poem word-to-word, second: combine it with iterations on cultural readability and tone, which were also open to cultural interpretation.

With our approach, rather than producing a mere reproduction of the original piece, we reframed Mulan's story as a powerful feminist narrative. We did a good job in preserving the literal meaning of *The Ballad of Mulan* and engaged the translation with the audience through emotional driven vocabulary choices.

However, there we find it hard to preserve the original structure of the sentence due to a fundamental difference between the two languages. I am proud to say, with inspiration from different theorists and authors, we have created a translation which went beyond cultural and time barriers.

Although this is just one piece of translation, the widespread popularity of the Disney animation Mulan allows readers to better comprehend the message we are conveying. By reaffirming Mulan's impactful figure, we have contributed to the broader conversation about gender roles in the 21st century through our thoughtful translation.
