# Weekly Response #0

## Course Expectations

Throughout this quarter I expect myself to manage my time efficiently and complete the readings, brainstorming and writings before the deadline with time spare for reflection. By granting myself more time to prepare, it will allow me to write better responses and more thoughtful paragraphs.

More importantly, I would expect myself to take every opportunity to improve my writing through feedback and self-reflection. I believe the easiest way to improve my writing is to learn from the mistakes and apply the knowledge I have learnt.

## What I'm Looking Forward To

In this course, I am looking forward to exploring American history through the various periods of film production, which reflects different history, culture, and technology of the given time period of American History. Moreover, by understanding the greater picture of the timeline of how American media has impacted society, it would allow me to understand the different aspects of contemporary media moments that are deeply rooted from the past of the entertainment industry.

### My Only Concern

My only concern this term is my productivity of completing the required reading. Although I am confident that I would be able to complete all the necessary reading before lectures, I am concerned about the quality of my annotations. However, with the help of the textbook, I am looking forward to improving my annotation skills throughout this term.

## My Knowledge of Hollywood

From my knowledge of Hollywood history, I know geographically it was based in Los Angeles and it is composed of several different major studios, such as:
- Universal Pictures
- Paramount Pictures
- Warner Bros
- Walt Disney Studio
- Sony Pictures

I believe that Hollywood films not only have shaped the culture of American society historically, its influence could be seen globally. Even as a person who grew up abroad, I have been watching American/Hollywood films since I was a little kid and it has really shaped my perspective on American culture.

Other than that, I have noticed that the genre of film produced in Hollywood has shifted overtime throughout history, from western to action comedy, to animations as technology evolved. In terms of American culture, as a sports and music fan, I have a brief understanding of the stories behind these productions or events. However, I am looking forward to learning more about the history of Hollywood films in detail and to explore the stories of Hollywood behind the scripts.

## Films That Impacted Me

### The Big Short

This film was recommended by my economics teacher, and I ended up really enjoying it, rewatching it a number of times. It covers economics concepts that caused the crash of the housing market in 2008. During the film, I would stop and google the concepts that were brought up in the movie, taking it forever for me to finish the film. After watching it, I always feel like I have learnt something new.

### Green Book

I was attracted by the trailer of the film that was based on a true story, two men from very different backgrounds and demographics come together due to an unforeseen cause. At first, both having very different values and life experiences, finding it hard to find compromise during their trip.

However, after the conflicts and experiences they have been through together, they developed friendship. For me, witnessing the forming of a friendship despite value and cultural differences were very wholesome. Seeing that they were letting go of the differences because of the deeper person they see in each other was a great experience as a movie viewer.
