# A Still Moment in the Mountains: Comparing Two Translations of Wang Wei

The Chinese poet Wang Wei is known for his nature poems that reflect quiet thinking, Buddhist ideas, and a deep love for the natural world. The four-lines poem we analyzed captures a moment of calm in the mountains, mixing what we see on the outside with peace on the inside.

## Understanding the Original

From my interpretation, the poem is about being present in emptiness, a world where sound bounces off silence, light shines through still trees, and meaning comes from what is left unsaid. This picture, shaped by Zen Buddhist values like change, the loss of ego, and quiet awareness, gives readers a deep and layered feeling instead of just one emotion.

Because of this, the best translation should keep the original's simple style, peaceful mood, and openness to different meanings.

## The Two Translations

When looking at two English versions, one by Soame Jenyns (1944) and the other by C. J. Chen and Michael Bullock (1960), Jenyns's version stands out as the better one. His translation not only stays closer to the original words and structure, but also better keeps the ideas and feeling behind Wang Wei's poem.

### Jenyns's Translation

Jenyns's translation reads:

> An empty hill, and no one in sight.
> But I hear the echo of voices.
> The slanting sun at evening penetrates the deep woods.
> And shines reflected on the blue lichens.

This version is very close to the structure and wording of the original Chinese, keeping both its plain style and quiet feeling. Jenyns doesn't explain the poem or add a personal voice. He lets the images speak for themselves.

This choice helps us see the poem as a quiet moment of thought and indirect feeling: the hill looks empty, yet there are voices; the sunlight doesn't shine straight on but bounces off something. These surprises match the Zen idea that truth doesn't always come straight at us, but shows itself in small, quiet ways. By keeping this mystery, Jenyns honors the poem's deep spiritual message.

### Chen and Bullock's Translation

On the other hand, Chen and Bullock's version goes:

> On the lonely mountain I meet no one,
> I hear only the echo of human voices.
> At an angle the sun's rays enter the depths of the wood,
> And shine upon the green moss.

While this version is easier to follow, it adds a narrator ("I meet no one"), brings in feelings with the word "lonely," and sounds more like a normal description. These changes shift the mood of the poem, moving it from quiet thinking to a more personal and possibly sad kind of aloneness.

## The Problem with "Lonely"

For Western readers used to poems that use "I" this might feel more familiar and emotional, but it changes Wang Wei's original tone. The word "lonely" especially stands out, replacing the calm word "empty" with something more emotional and personal.

In Buddhism, **emptiness isn't a bad thing**—it means openness, freedom, and the absence of ego. "Lonely," however, suggests someone is sad and wants company. This one word weakens the peaceful detachment that is so important in the original.

## Sound and Rhythm

Jenyns's translation also works better in sound and mood. Phrases like "slanting sun," "deep woods," and "blue lichens" have a soft, smooth rhythm that matches the calm feeling of the poem. The sounds are gentle and thoughtful, encouraging a slow, quiet reading.

Chen and Bullock's version, while clear, feels more like plain speech. For example, "At an angle the sun's rays enter…" sounds like something from a science book, not a poem. This lack of musical flow makes it harder to feel the quiet mood that had a peaceful balance between light, shadow, and sound.

## Trust in the Reader

Another strong point in Jenyns's version is that he doesn't explain the poem. He trusts the reader to understand without being told. The "echo of voices" is just an image, not a hint at a certain feeling. This careful approach fits the Buddhist idea of being aware: noticing without clinging, seeing without judging.

Chen and Bullock, by making the poem more clear and emotional, risk taking away its thoughtful depth. Their added speaker makes the scene feel more like a personal memory than a universal moment of peace.

## The Counterargument

Of course, some people might say that Chen and Bullock's version is easier to relate to, especially for modern or Western readers. Their use of "I" and emotional words makes the poem easier to follow and connect with. For younger readers or people new to Chinese poetry, this version might be a good introduction.

But this ease comes with a downside. It flattens the poem's deep meanings and pushes one emotional view instead of leaving room for quiet thought.

## Conclusion

Jenyns's version might ask more from the reader, but that effort brings greater reward. His translation invites us into the same calm state of mind from the poem, encouraging us to hear echoes, watch slanting light, and rest in stillness. In doing so, Jenyns not only keeps the poem's surface meaning but also its deeper spiritual goal.

To sum up, Jenyns's translation is stronger because it keeps the original's simple style, peaceful mood, and openness to different meanings, which best matches my interpretation of Wang Wei's work. His careful word choice, calm tone, and trust in the reader all help create a version that matches the poem's calm and Zen spirit. Instead of making the poem more personal or emotional, Jenyns lets the quiet images and deep peace of the original speak for themselves.
