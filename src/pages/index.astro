			<h1>Welcome to My CAT Writing Portfolio</h1>
			<p>
				This site showcases my academic writing journey through UC San Diego's <strong>Culture, Art, and Technology (CAT)</strong> program.
				Here you'll find essays, reflections, and analyses exploring the intersection of film, culture, and society.
			</p>

			<h2>About the CAT Program</h2>
			<p>
				The CAT program is an interdisciplinary sequence at UC San Diego that examines how culture, art,
				and technology shape our understanding of the world. Through critical analysis of film, literature,
				and cultural artifacts, the program develops skills in close reading, analytical writing, and
				cultural interpretation.
			</p>

			<h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
			<p>This portfolio includes writing from multiple quarters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>CAT 1:</strong> Film analysis and weekly responses exploring American cinema and cultural history</li>
				<li><strong>CAT 3:</strong> Translation studies and cross-cultural interpretation, including work on <em>The Ballad of Mulan</em></li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Writing Themes</h2>
			<p>Throughout my work, you'll find recurring themes including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Film as a cultural and historical artifact</li>
				<li>Gender representation and power in cinema</li>
				<li>The colonial gaze and representation of marginalized communities</li>
				<li>Translation theory and cross-cultural communication</li>
				<li>Immigration, identity, and belonging</li>
			</ul>
