	<h2>About Oscar Hung</h2>
	<p>
		I'm a student at UC San Diego who was enrolled in the Culture, Art, and Technology (CAT) program.
		This portfolio represents my academic writing journey as I explore the intersection of film,
		culture, translation, and critical theory.
	</p>

	<h3>My Writing Journey</h3>
	<p>
		When I first started the CAT program, I struggled with organizing my thoughts and writing
		cohesive paragraphs. Through consistent practice and feedback, I've developed strategies
		to become a clearer and more focused writer. One of my biggest lessons has been learning
		that <strong>to be a good writer, you must first be a good reader</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>
		By improving my annotation techniques and taking time to deeply engage with course materials,
		I've been able to express more complex ideas in an organized manner. This growth is reflected
		in the various essays and analyses featured on this site.
	</p>

	<h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
	<p>Through my CAT coursework, I've developed particular interests in:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Film as Cultural Commentary:</strong> Understanding how cinema reflects and shapes
		societal values, particularly during historical periods like the Great Depression</li>
		<li><strong>Gender and Power in Media:</strong> Analyzing how female characters navigate
		restrictive social structures and find agency within constraints</li>
		<li><strong>Colonial Representation:</strong> Examining the "voyeuristic gaze" and how
		Western media portrays non-Western subjects</li>
		<li><strong>Translation Theory:</strong> Exploring how meaning transforms across languages
		and cultures, particularly through my work on <em>The Ballad of Mulan</em></li>
		<li><strong>Immigration and Identity:</strong> Investigating themes of belonging, cultural
		preservation, and the immigrant experience</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope these writings demonstrate not only my growth
		as a writer but also my engagement with important cultural and theoretical concepts.
